                                In life, everything is connected and has a foundation. 
                                This includes praise, which can be successful or fail depending on how it is given.
                                 Effective praise is grounded in a focus on God, who is the foundation it should stand on.   <br> <br>
                                 To offer excellent praise, it must be rooted in faith, which is based on love.
                                 Love, in turn, is rooted in grace, and grace is rooted in the blood of Jesus. 
                                 Ultimately, God is the ultimate source and is not rooted in anything. 
                                 In summary, everything 
                                in life is interconnected, and in the Kingdom of God, everything works through faith, love, grace, and God Himself.
