                                In the realm of faith, we believe that God has a unique plan for each person.
                                 He sends messages to guide us towards greatness, presenting us with customized 
                                 blessings tailored to meet our 
                                 individual needs. However, many blessings go unclaimed, often because
                                 we are not present or attentive enough to recognize them when they arrive at their appointed time

                                         It is important to be present and attentive to receive these

                                    <li><p class="datapp"> There are so many unclaimed blessings because 
                                            we may not always know when they are meant to arrive and the recipients
                                             may not be present to receive it at the appointed time..</p></li>

                                    When blessed with an assignment or appointment, it is crucial to approach it with diligence and without complaint, 
                                    as God's favour can turn failure into success and transform one's character and purpose. 
                                    Remember that your life itself is also a favor from God, so refrain from becoming a complainer. 
                                    Peter was tired after toiling all night and catching no fish but Jesus still chose him out of all the 
                                    people there. </p></li>

                                            <i> When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break. 7
                                             So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled 
                                             both boats so full that they began to sink.</i>

                                    <li><p class="datapp">  Jesus told Peter to set sail and let down his net, he obeyed without complaint and
                                    in the same place that he had failed, he succeeded as the fishes decided to be a part of the miracle. 
                                    Favour turned failure to success. The favour of God transformed Peter from a
                                    fisherman to a fisher of men and today we still know his name but many of his peers are unknown today.</p></li>

                                         Do not become spiritually blinded as it is better to be physically blind than spiritually blind.</p></li>

                                         <li><p class="datapp"> With favour from God,
                                             one can conceive an idea that can lead them to where they ought to be and
                                              as they nurse the idea,
                                             it can transform their character and prayer positively to bring forth meaningful results.</p></li>
