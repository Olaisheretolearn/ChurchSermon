                                Today, we delve into the remarkable truth that there is a perfect 
                                time set by God to pour out His blessings upon us. So, grab a cup of coffee, settle in, 
                                and let's discover the incredible ways God orchestrates His favor.
                               <br> <br> In the symphony of life, God conducts each moment with precision. 
                                Just as Psalm 102:13 reminds us, there is a designated time for God's favor 
                                to manifest in our lives. This realization fills our hearts with hope and anticipation, 
                                knowing that our heavenly Father has a remarkable plan for each of us.
                                Throughout history, we encounter inspiring accounts that exemplify the power of God's favor. 
                                Joseph, despite enduring hardships, was suddenly called from the darkness of prison to serve 
                                as a prominent leader. Similarly, Mordecai, a humble servant, experienced a divine shift in 
                                circumstances when his appointed time of favor arrived. 
                                These narratives remind us that God's timing is never late; it is always perfect.

                    <li><p class="datapp"> The blessings/grace of Jesus is enough to go round. 
                    Jesus left the feast to heal the man by the Bethesda pool because his time for favour had come.  </p></li>

                        can stop God when the set time of favour comes </p></li>
