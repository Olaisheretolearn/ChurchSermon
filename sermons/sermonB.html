                                The sermon discusses the concept of Divine Help, 
                                stating that man is truly at peace when God grants him rest. 
                                The speaker highlights that divine help, a crucial need for everyone at some point in life, 
                                could involve guidance along a specific path, arriving always at the right time. 
                                Divine help is defined as outcomes from various divine interventions and ongoing preservation 
                                of our destiny and interests as God's children. The sermon warns that without divine help, 
                                one risks being stranded or grounded, and while men can be instruments of God's help, 
                                they should not be seen as its source. The most critical form of help needed is deliverance from self.
