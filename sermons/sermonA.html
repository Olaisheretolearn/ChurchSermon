                                In his sermon, Pastor Tolu Otegbade speaks on the topic of "Raising our Tempo of Praise". 
                                He emphasizes that increasing the intensity of our praise to God leads to greater victories. 
                                He reminds believers not to lessen their praise in times of hardship, 
                                but rather, consciously remember God's manifold blessings, as mentioned in
                                 Romans 3:20 and Psalm 103:1-2. Raising our praise not only acknowledges God's 
                                 good deeds but also signifies gratitude and readiness for future divine assistance.
                                 Pastor Tolu concludes by warning against ingratitude, exemplified by the nine lepers in the Bible

                    <li><p class="datapp">We must not reduce the tempo of our praise whenever we face issues. To maintain our praise, we must consciously 
                        take our minds off the one issue and praise God for the 99 benefits.</p></li>


                    <li><p class="datapp">Challenges of life can make one forget the many things that God has done. 
                        We must deliberately remember His benefits, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A30&version=NIV">Rom 3:20</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+103%3A1-2&version=NIV">Psa 103:1-2.</a> </p></li>

                                   
                                   

                    <li><p class="datapp">We need to raise our praise tempo because it is a reminder to heaven even though God did not forget. A time will come when we have no more prayer points. We will always have praise points. </p></li>


                    <li><p class="datapp">We need to raise our praise tempo because it is an effort to ensure we have done all God has expected us to do. We show God that we are people of gratitude 
                        and also that we are eligible to be helped again. We must not be like the nine lepers.</p></li>
